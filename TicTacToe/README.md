# Tic Tac Toe Game with AI (Magic Square Method)

## 📌 Problem Statement
Design and implement a **Tic Tac Toe game** in C++ where the player competes against an AI-controlled opponent. The AI should use **magic square properties** to make optimal moves, blocking the player's winning chances and attempting to win whenever possible.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Enable a human player (`X`) to play Tic Tac Toe against a computer-controlled opponent (`O`).
- Ensure the AI is **strategic** using the **Magic Square Algorithm** for quick win detection and blocking.
- Provide a **command-line interface** for gameplay.

---

## 🗂 Data Structures Used
1. **`vector<char>`**  
   - Stores the current state of the board (`'X'`, `'O'`, or `' '` for empty).
   - Index mapping:  
     ```
     0 | 1 | 2
     3 | 4 | 5
     6 | 7 | 8
     ```

2. **`const int magic[9]`**  
   - Magic square mapping to positions for win-checking using sum=15 logic:  
     ```
     8  1  6
     3  5  7
     4  9  2
     ```

3. **`vector<int>`**  
   - Stores magic numbers for positions occupied by each player.

4. **Arrays for win conditions**  
   - Predefined `wins[8][3]` list for standard row/column/diagonal checking.

## ⚙️ Algorithms

### 1. **State Generation**
- The **board state** is a vector of 9 characters.
- On each turn:
  - Player move is inserted directly from input.
  - AI move is computed via the **Magic Square Algorithm**.

### 2. **AI Move Selection (Magic Square Method)**
The AI selects moves in priority order:
1. **Win Move:** If AI can complete a line (sum=15 with two AI magic numbers + empty position), choose that.
2. **Block Move:** If the player can win in the next move, block it.
3. **Center Control:** Choose the center if available (index 4).
4. **Corner Preference:** Choose one of the corners.
5. **Edge Preference:** Choose one of the sides.
6. **Fallback:** Choose any remaining empty space.

### 3. **Winner Detection**
- Either:
  - Check using predefined winning combinations (`wins` array).
  - OR by checking if any 3 magic numbers sum to 15.

## 🖥 Sample Output
```text
Tic-Tac-Toe (Magic Square AI)
You are X, computer is O.

Board:
 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9

User's turn
Your move (1-9): 1
 You entered: 1

Board:
 X | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9

 Computer's turn
 Computer chooses index 4 (pos 5)

Board:
 X | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | O | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9

User's turn
Your move (1-9): 4
 You entered: 4

Board:
 X | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 X | O | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9

 Computer's turn
 Computer chooses index 6 (pos 7)

Board:
 X | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 X | O | 6
---+---+---
 O | 8 | 9

User's turn
Your move (1-9): 2
 You entered: 2

Board:
 X | X | 3
---+---+---
 X | O | 6
---+---+---
 O | 8 | 9

 Computer's turn
 Computer chooses index 2 (pos 3)

Board:
 X | X | O
---+---+---
 X | O | 6
---+---+---
 O | 8 | 9

Computer WINS.
Game over.

```

## 📊 Time Complexity
- **Winner check:** O(1) — only 8 winning lines to check.
- **AI move selection:** O(9²) worst case — checking all available positions and possible sums.
- **Overall:** O(1) per turn — because board size is fixed (3×3).

---

## 🏆 Conclusion
This implementation demonstrates how **mathematical properties** like magic squares can be applied to **game AI** to produce efficient and unbeatable opponents for small board games like Tic Tac Toe.  
It’s a simple yet powerful way to introduce both **AI decision-making** and **mathematical problem solving** in programming.
